# Database


You have assign to design Database for sale item code system for game
this provide for customer who want to buy code for using in game.

  **Detail**
  
  - Item for sale must have product name, product detail, sale price, open sale date, end sale date.
  - When customer already bought an item, customer will receive code (code can be created or create after bought).
  - item have a discount promotion period with specific date time for example normal price is 150 baht and have a promotion on January and set discounted price to 100 baht.

  **Bonus**

  - Item type shared stock (no matter how you buy item on which price, it suppose to use code on same stock) for example, have an item A and B on system when it sold either item A or item B, code that customer will receive come from same stock.
  - item may sale in bundle type for example sale two difference character skin set in special price or sale five gachapon box (for random item) in special price.

  **Hint**

  - Create database in form of model from [sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize)
  
  **Example Model**

  ```js
  const User = sequelize.define('User', {
    id: Sequelize.INTEGER,
    name: Sequelize.STRING,
    age: Sequelize.INTEGER,
  },{
    classMethods: {
      associate: function(models) {
        User.hasMany(UserCard, { foreignKey: 'user_id' })
      }
    }
  })

  const UserCard = sequelize.define('UserCard', {
    id: Sequelize.STRING,
    user_id: Sequelize.STRING,
    card_number: Sequelize.STRING,
    cvv: Sequelize.INTEGER
  },{
    classMethods: {
      associate: function(models) {
        UserCard.belongsTo(User, { foreignKey: 'user_id' })
      }
    }
  })
  ```
